# The height formalism of Mochizuki's "Arithmetic elliptic curves in general position"

This file introduces an abstract interface for the theory of heights on hyperbolic curves
over number fields, as reviewed in §1 of [mochizuki2010]. The interface `Genl.HeightTheory`
records exactly the data that is needed to *state* Theorem 2.1 of [mochizuki2010]:

- a type of "curves", to be thought of as pairs `(X, D)` of a smooth, proper, geometrically
  connected curve `X` over a number field together with a reduced effective divisor
  `D ⊆ X`, with `U_X := X \ D`;
- for each curve the set of algebraic points `U_X(ℚ̄)`, filtered by the degree
  `[F(x) : ℚ]` of the minimal field of definition `F(x)` of a point `x`
  (cf. Example 1.3 (i) of [mochizuki2010]);
- the predicates "`U_X` is a hyperbolic curve" (i.e. `deg ω_X(D) > 0`) and "`D = ∅`";
- the height `ht_{ω_X(D)}` associated to the log canonical bundle `ω_X(D)`
  (Definition 1.2 (i)), the log-different `log-diff_X` (Definition 1.5 (iii)) and the
  log-conductor `log-cond_D` (Definition 1.5 (iv)), all real valued functions on
  `U_X(ℚ̄)`;
- a distinguished curve, the *tripod* `(ℙ¹_ℚ, {0, 1, ∞})`, together with the collection of
  *compactly bounded subsets* `K_V ⊆ U_ℙ(ℚ̄)` whose support contains a fixed finite set of
  prime numbers `Σ` (Example 1.3 (ii)).

The set `Σ` of Theorem 2.1 of [mochizuki2010] is implicit in the field `CBS`: it does not
appear anywhere else in the statement of the theorem.

All functions are taken to be genuine functions rather than BD-classes; the statements
only refer to their BD-classes via the relations `≲[s]` and `≈[s]` of
`Genl.Mathlib.Order.BoundedDiscrepancy`.

Everything in this file is *data*; the substantial inputs from arithmetic geometry that
the proof of Theorem 2.1 consumes are recorded separately in
`Genl.GeneralPosition.ProofPackage`.

/-- An abstract height formalism in the sense of §1 of [mochizuki2010], containing the
data needed to state Theorem 2.1 of loc. cit.

A term `X : T.Curve` should be thought of as a pair `(X, D)` of a smooth, proper,
geometrically connected curve over a number field and a reduced effective divisor on it,
and `T.Pt X` as the set of algebraic points of `U_X = X \ D`. -/
