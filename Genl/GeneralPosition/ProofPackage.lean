# The arithmetic-geometric inputs to the proof of Theorem 2.1

The proof of the implication (ii) ⇒ (i) of Theorem 2.1 of [mochizuki2010] consumes a
number of substantial inputs from arithmetic geometry, all of which are external to the
formal ε-bookkeeping of the proof itself:

- the existence of connected finite étale Galois coverings of hyperbolic curves that are
  ramified at prescribed points with prescribed ramification index (a consequence of the
  structure of étale fundamental groups of hyperbolic curves in characteristic zero),
  together with the comparison of heights, log-differents and log-conductors along such
  coverings (Propositions 1.4, 1.6, 1.7 of [mochizuki2010]);
- the theory of noncritical Belyi maps ([mochizuki2004], Theorem 2.5), combined with a
  compactness argument for the sets of local points at the places of a finite set `V`, and
  again Propositions 1.4, 1.6, 1.7 of [mochizuki2010].

This file records these inputs as the two fields of the structure
`Genl.HeightTheory.ProofPackage`:

- `Covering X d ε'` (packaged by the field `covering`) corresponds to the first paragraph
  of the proof of Theorem 2.1 (p. 13 of [mochizuki2010]): a Galois covering `Y → X`,
  ramified exactly over `D` with large ramification index, along which points of degree
  `≤ d` lift to points of degree `≤ d'`, heights compare via
  `ht_{ω_X(D)} ∘ π ≲ (1 + ε') ht_{ω_Y}`, and log-differents compare via Proposition 1.7 (i).
- `BelyiDescent X d ε` (packaged by the field `belyi`) corresponds to the second half of
  the proof (pp. 13–14 of [mochizuki2010]): if the inequality of statement (i) *fails* on
  `X(ℚ̄)^{=d}` for a hyperbolic `X` with `D = ∅`, there are a subset `Ξ ⊆ X(ℚ̄)^{=d}` on
  which the failure persists after dropping any bounded part, a noncritical Belyi map
  `φ : X → ℙ` mapping `Ξ` into a compactly bounded subset `K_V`, and the comparison
  (in)equalities of heights, log-differents and log-conductors along `φ` printed in the
  displayed chain on p. 14, with `E := φ^{-1}(C)_red` and `q = deg E / deg ω_X`.

Instantiating `ProofPackage` for the "true" height theory of curves over number fields
amounts to formalising §1 of [mochizuki2010] together with the noncritical Belyi maps of
[mochizuki2004]; this is tracked in the project blueprint.

/-- The output of the first paragraph of the proof of Theorem 2.1 of [mochizuki2010],
for a hyperbolic curve `(X, D)`, a degree bound `d` and a tolerance `ε' > 0`: a connected
finite étale Galois covering `Y → X` of the underlying curves, ramified at each point of
`E = (D ×_X Y)_red` with the same large ramification index `e`, considered as a divisor
free pair `(Y, ∅)`.

The fields `surjOn`, `logDiff_le` and `htCan_le` package, respectively: that every point
of `U_X(ℚ̄)^{≤d}` lifts to a point of `U_Y(ℚ̄)^{≤d'}` where `d' = d · deg(Y/X)`; the
comparison `log-diff_Y ≲ log-diff_X + log-cond_D` on `U_Y(ℚ̄)^{≤d'}` from
Proposition 1.7 (i); and the comparison `ht_{ω_X(D)} ∘ π ≲ (1 + ε') ht_{ω_Y}` on
`U_Y(ℚ̄)^{≤d'}` obtained from Propositions 1.4 (i), (ii), (iii) and 1.7 (ii) by choosing
the ramification index `e` sufficiently large. -/

/-- The output of the second half of the proof of Theorem 2.1 of [mochizuki2010]
(pp. 13–14), for a divisor free hyperbolic curve `X` on which the inequality of statement
(i) fails on `X(ℚ̄)^{=d}` for the tolerance `ε`: a set `Ξ ⊆ X(ℚ̄)^{=d}` witnessing the
failure in the strong form `unbounded`, together with (the map on points of) a noncritical
Belyi map `φ : X → ℙ` that is unramified over `U_ℙ`, noncritical at the finitely many limit
tuples of `Ξ`, and maps `Ξ` into `K_V ∩ U_ℙ(ℚ̄)^{≤d'}` for a compactly bounded subset
`K_V` whose support contains `Σ`.

Writing `E = φ^{-1}(C)_red ⊆ X`, the remaining fields package the displayed comparisons
on p. 14 of [mochizuki2010], as (in)equalities of BD-classes on `Ξ`:

- `htCan_equiv`: `ht_{ω_X} ≈ ht_{ω_ℙ(C)} ∘ φ - ht_E`, from `φ^* ω_ℙ(C) ≅ ω_X(E)` and
  Proposition 1.4 (i), (iii);
- `logDiff_comp_le`: `log-diff_ℙ ∘ φ + log-cond_C ∘ φ ≲ log-diff_X + log-cond_E`, from
  Proposition 1.7 (i) applied to `φ` (with `e = 1`);
- `logCondE_le`: `log-cond_E ≲ ht_E`, from Proposition 1.6;
- `htE_equiv`: `ht_E ≈ q • ht_{ω_X}` with `q = deg E / deg ω_X > 0`.

bundle `O_X(E)`, and `log-cond_E` the log-conductor of the pair `(X, E)`. -/
